# 🌫️ Visibility Restoration in Foggy Images 

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on **improving the visibility of distant objects in foggy images**.  
It is based on **Koschmieder’s law**, which models fog attenuation.  
By reversing the fog effect, the algorithm restores image clarity and enhances distant object detection.
