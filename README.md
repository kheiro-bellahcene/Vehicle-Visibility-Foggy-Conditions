## Introduction

This project improves the visibility of distant objects in foggy images.  
It is based on Koschmiederâ€™s law, which models fog attenuation, allowing us to restore images by reversing the fog effect.

---

## Features

- Estimation of atmospheric veil (fog effect).  
- Restoration of visibility in both grayscale and color images.  
- Enhanced detection of distant vehicles.

*This project aims to improve safety for ADAS systems in degraded weather conditions.*
